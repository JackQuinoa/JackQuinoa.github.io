I decided to study software engineering because I've always loved computers and I enjoy the puzzle side to coding. I love feeling like a detective figuring out why something doesn't work and what the solution is. Also, I felt as if a traditional four year school was not for me and that's why I chose Flatiron's camp. Everyone's just looking for their right path through life and I feel as if this is mine.
